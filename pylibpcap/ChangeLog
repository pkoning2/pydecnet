  pylibpcap-0.6.3, 5 January 2012

  * pcap_interface.c: Release the GIL when calling into libpcap,
    to allow other threads to run. (SF bug #2080784)
  * pcap_interface.c: Minor improvements to exception processing.
    Fixes SF bug #1758709, probably others.
  * mk-constants.py: Added more DLT_ values from tcpdump.org.
  * Regenerated pcap.c and pcap.py using SWIG 1.3.31.

  pylibpcap-0.6.2, 25 January 2008

  Some files were missing from the tarball depending on how it was
  packaged; added them to MANIFEST.in to make sure they get included.
  Also updated mk-constants with the latest DLT_* entries from
  tcpdump.org.

  pylibpcap-0.6.1, 25 July 2007

  Clarified the license terms. Rewrote some of the module initialization
  to hopefully make it less fragile when SWIG changes. Added a bunch of
  new DLT_* constants. Made a few changes to the syntax in pcap.i to match
  with the current SWIG-1.3.x syntax.

  pylibpcap-0.6, 2007-02-14

  To install run:
      python ./setup.py install

  For Ubuntu/Debian systems you will probably need to install
  the libpcap development package:
     apt-get install libpcap-dev

  Had to manually add SWIG_PY_INT to mk-constants.py to support
  swig-1.3.31

  Normalized indentation to Python semi-standard 4 spaces.

  Changed #!/usr/bin/env lines from python2 to python, since
  no distros use python2 anymore.

  pylibpcap-0.5, released 7/3/2005

  This release contains the patches that have been accumulating in CVS,
  and supports some features of newer libpcaps. It should build for
  libpcap bersions >= 0.8.3. It can be built for earlier versions by
  uncommenting lines in setup.py according to which features your version
  of libpcap supports.  [wiml]

  Apr 25, 2004 [wiml]:

  There is a bug in libpcap and/or OpenBSD3.4 which results in a SEGV
  if you call findalldevs() and you have a gif tunnel configured.
  (See libpcap bug #941924 for details:
    http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?
	func=detail&aid=941924&group_id=53067&atid=469577 )
