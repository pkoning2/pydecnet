To compile, you will need the Python include files, libpcap 0.7.1 (or
later) includes and library, as well as SWIG 1.3.12 if you wish to
modify the interface (see http://www.swig.org for more information).
If you do wish to modify the interface, you'll need to change 'pcap.c'
to 'pcap.i' in the setup.py script.  Most users won't need to touch
this however.

On Ubuntu/Debian systems you can install the libpcap development
package in order to get the headers:
    apt-get install libpcap-dev

Alternately, you can download pcap from www.tcpdump.org if it is not
already installed on your system (or if your vendor's version is old).

To build, simply run "python ./setup.py build", or "python2 ./setup.py build"

You may need to edit setup.py if you are not using a recent libpcap.
See the comments in that file for more information.

To install, run "python ./setup.py install"

To run the sample program 'sniff.py', specify the interface name and 
filter expression on the command line like so:

[root@linuxbox pylibpcap]# ./sniff.py eth0 tcp port 80 

Please refer to the online module documentation (__doc__ attributes), and 
the pcap man page further information
