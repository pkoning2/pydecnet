<h2 id="mapdatadoc">Description of the network map data table.</h2>
<p>
The map data comes from two sources: the node database, and
the network scanner results.
</p><p> 
The node database is read from <a
href="http://mim.update.uu.se/nodedb">the HECnet node name database at
MIM</a>.  The code extracts name, node 
address, owner's name, name of the node's location, and location 
latitude/longitude.  This information is retrieved daily.  If your node
location information is missing or incorrect, please contact <a
href="mailto:bqt@mim.update.uu.se">Johnny Billquist</a>, the keeper of
the HECnet node database.
</p><p> 
The network scanner looks at every node mentioned in the node database 
plus every node it can see as reachable.  From these, it collects
information about nodes and circuits (connections between nodes).
</p><p> 
The map display takes as input the node and adjacent-node information 
collected by the scanner and summarizes it in two steps.  First, all 
the nodes are grouped by latitude/longitude.  Each distinct spot on 
the map is given a marker associated with all the nodes at that 
location.   Nodes without location information are assigned the
placeholder coordinates 37° 18′ S, 12° 41′ W (the location of
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inaccessible_Island">Inaccessible 
Island</a>).
</p><p> 
</p> 
<h2>Colors and fonts used in the map data table</h2> 
<p> 
Each item (node or circuit) has a "health" which is similar to its
up/down status. </p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Health</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="hs3">Up</span></td><td>Node or circuit is currently visible to the
      scanner as operational</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="hs2">Down</span></td><td>Node or circuit is not currently visible to the
      scanner, or it is seen in the scan but the reported status is
      "not operational"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="hs1">Faded</span></td><td>Node or circuit has been "down" for more than
      two weeks, or node has never been seen as "up".</td>
  </tr>
</table>
