<h2>Description of the network mapper system.</h2>
<p>
First of all, some background on how it works.  There are three parts: 
the node database, the network scanner, and the map display maker. 
</p><p> 
The node database is read from <a
href="http://mim.update.uu.se/nodedb">the HECnet node name database at
MIM</a>.  The code extracts name, node 
address, owner's name, name of the node's location, and location 
latitude/longitude.  This information is retrieved daily.  If your node
location information is missing or incorrect, please contact <a
href="mailto:bqt@mim.update.uu.se">Johnny Billquist</a>, the keeper of
the HECnet node database.
</p><p> 
For some nodes, the node database does not give a location.  If so,
the map data table shows the location as blank, and the map display
shows the node in the South Atlantic Ocean, at <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inaccessible_Island">Inaccessible 
Island</a> (in honor of Daniel Suarez's novel "Influx").
</p><p> 
The network scanner looks at every node mentioned in the node database 
plus every node it can see as reachable.  Roughly speaking, it makes a 
NICE connection (remote network management protocol) to each node, 
then asks it three questions: "show exec characteristics ", "show
active circuits" and "show active nodes".  The first questions answers
"what type of node is this" and also gets the node name if we do not
already know it.  The other two give the adjacent nodes, i.e., the 
connections from this node to its neighbors.  Often but not always, 
that information includes the node type of the adjacent nodes. 
</p><p> 
This process continues iteratively until information for all visible 
nodes has been refreshed. 
</p><p> 
There are some optimizations and tricks.  If a node is reported as 
reachable in the "show active nodes" reply (whether as a neighbor or
farther away) it's recorded as reachable, even if the network scanner
can't talk to it.  
This means that Phase II nodes, Phase III nodes in another area, or 
Cisco routers will all be shown as reachable so long as there is a 
node somewhere that answers NICE requests and shows them as reachable. 
</p><p> 
Also, for optimization, if a node reports a neighbor's type as Phase 
II or Phase III (in another area) or endnode, the network scanner
doesn't try to connect  
to it because it already has all the information needed.  This speeds 
up the scan.  It also avoids a bug in DECnet/E where "show active
nodes" on an endnode leaves the request hanging after the reply data
is sent (the "no more data" message is missing).
</p><p> 
At the completion of the scan, the up/down information is updated. 
Currently each node, and each adjacency entry for that node, has three 
timestamps: last up, last down, and last seen.  During the scan, when 
a node is seen as visible, or when an adjacent node is reported, that 
entry is marked with the current time as "last seen".  When the scan
is finished, the entire database is examined.  Any item not marked 
with the current timestamp in "last seen" is currently down.  If it
was previously up (its "last up" time is greater than its "last down")
then "last down" is set to the current time. Similarly, any item
previously marked "down" ("last down" greater than "last up") has its
"last up" set to the current time.
</p><p> 
The map display takes as input the node and adjacent-node information 
collected by the scanner and summarizes it in two steps.  First, all 
the nodes are grouped by latitude/longitude.  Each distinct spot on 
the map is given a marker associated with all the nodes at that 
location.   Nodes without location information are assigned the
placeholder coordinates 37° 18′ S, 12° 41′ W (the location of
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inaccessible_Island">Inaccessible 
Island</a>).
</p><p> 
Next, all the circuits (adjacent node) information is examined, 
grouped by lat/long of the endpoints.  An arc on the map corresponds 
to all the connections between node pairs at the location markers 
connected by that arc. 
</p>
<h3>Incremental scan</h3>
<p>The mapper is an "event monitor" and will react to node or circuit
change events send to the DECnet node of which it is part by
performing a partial scan of the network.  For a node reachable event, it
will scan that node; for a circuit change, it will scan the nodes at
the endpoints of that circuit.  For a node unreachable event, the node
is simply marked as unreachable (no scan is done for this case).
<p></p>
<h2>Colors used on the map</h2> 
<p> 
Each item (node or circuit) has a "health" which is similar to its
up/down status. In the table below, the type color and style for the
different "Value" entries are how that health value is shown in the
map data table.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Value</th><th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="hs3">Up</span></td><td>Node or circuit is currently visible to the
      scanner as operational</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="hs2">Down</span></td><td>Node or circuit is not currently visible to the
      scanner, or it is seen in the scan but the reported status is
      "not operational"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="hs1">Faded</span></td><td>Node or circuit has been "down" for more than
      two weeks, or node has never been seen as "up".</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
A possible future enhancement would add a "warning" status, which would
be something 
like "it is up now but it has been bouncing up/down a lot" but that
isn't currently in the code. 
</p><p> 
Location markers and connection arcs both summarize multiple nodes and 
circuits.  The color used for these comes from the health of the 
components that go into them.
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Color</th><th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center"><img
      src="images/marker-icon-green.png"></td><td>All nodes at this
	location, or all circuits on this path, are "up"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center"><img
      src="images/marker-icon-yellow.png"></td><td>The majority, but
	not all, nodes at this
	location, or circuits on this path, are "up"</td>
  </tr>
    <td style="text-align:center"><img
      src="images/marker-icon-red.png"></td><td>At least half
	of the nodes at this
	location, or circuits on this path, are "down"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center"><img
      src="images/marker-icon-gray.png"></td><td>All nodes at this
	location, or circuits on this path, are "faded".  But if a
	path is "faded" for more than 180 days, it is not plotted on
	the map at all.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
All location markers have a popup (window that appears when you click 
the marker) which lists the nodes at that location, grouped by heath 
status (up in black, down in red, faded in gray italics).  
Exception: the default marker at Inaccessible Island
omits gray nodes because there are too many.  A 
location marker that isn't gray also has a tool tip (appears when you 
hover over the marker) which lists the up and down nodes only, not the 
faded ones. 
</p><p> 
Arcs also have popups, which list the individual circuits for this 
path by their end point node names/numbers. 
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Map data table</h2>
<p>
The map data table shows the underlying data collected by the mapper,
in tabular form sorted by node number.  For each node, it shows the
address and name, node typoe, location if shown in the database, and
time when the node status was last changed to down, and was last
changed to up, if applicable.  The status is indicated by the color
and style of the node address/name text: black text is "up", red is
"down", and gray italic is "faded".
</p><p>
If the mapper obtained circuit information from a given node, that is
shown as a nested table below the line for the node information.  For
each circuit, it shows the circuit name, adjacent node address and
name, adjacent node location if known, and last down and last up
timestamps.  As before, the name color and style indicates the status
of the circuit.
<p></p>
<h2>Map controls</h2>
<p>
The zoom in/out is at the top left.  Just below it is the "help"
button which shows map documentation. The button at the 
top right is the layers tool, which lets you choose from a number of 
map sources, and also allows you to turn on/off the location and/or 
path display separately for the backbone (area routers and connections
between area routers) and level 1.
</p><p> 
There is also a tabular display, sorted by node 
number, accessible via a link on the map display.  It 
shows more detail than can comfortably fit on the map itself. 
</p><p> 
The map images come from various map sources, such as 
OpenStreetMap.  They all use Mercator projection, and there isn't a 
convenient way to change.  The map machinery 
has some limitations (or bugs).  For example, 
if you zoom way out you'll see the continents more than once, which is 
proper, but the markers only appear on one copy.
