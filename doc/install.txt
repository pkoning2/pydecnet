Prerequisites

PyDECnet requires Python 3.3 or later.

Apart from standard Python modules, pydecnet uses the following
optional modules:

1. python-daemon: if present, the --daemon command line option is
   available.
2. PyYAML: if present, the logging configuration file specified by the
   --log-config command line option can be a YAML file.  If not, only
   JSON configuration files are supported.
3. python-pam: if present, username/password authentication for DECnet
   objects is available.  (TODO: not yet implemented)

Installation

PyDECnet is a conventional pure Python module together with a top
level script ("pydecnet").  To install it, use the "pip" tool:

pip3 install decnet-1.0.tar.gz

(substitute the actual PyDECnet source tar archive in the command.)

Unit test

PyDECnet comes with a unit test collection.  This is mostly for
development use, but feel free to use it.  To invoke it, use this
command: 

    python3.3 -m unittest discover

Add "-v" to the end to see the name of each executed test as it runs.
