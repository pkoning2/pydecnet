""" Mirror (loopback application) implementation.

Implementation of the DECnet network management loopback protocol.
Refer to the specification:
    DECnet Digital Network Architecture Phase IV
    Network Management Functional Specification
    Order no. AA-X437A-TK (December 1983)
The protocol is described on page 172 of that document.

This module also serves as sample code for writing standalone program
applications in Python.  For the corresponding built-in module version
of MIRROR (which is the one that is the default built-in object 25) see
modules/mirror.py.  

This version uses the AsyncPipeConnector to wrap the low level JSON
interface.  For this particular example, that's overkill (there isn't
any actual parallelism in the mirror server), but it will do as a
simple example of the use of that connector.
