"""Poor Man's Router implementation

This implements the Poor Man's Routing service, also known as
Passthrough, an application layer connection relay.  This was used in
various DECnet scenarios to reach nodes that are not reachable by
routing layer mechanism: non-adjacent Phase II nodes, out of area
nodes from Phase III nodes, or "hidden area" destinations in large
networks such as DEC's Engineering Network.
