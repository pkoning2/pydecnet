""" Mirror (loopback application) implementation.

Implementation of the DECnet network management loopback protocol.
Refer to the specification:
    DECnet Digital Network Architecture Phase IV
    Network Management Functional Specification
    Order no. AA-X437A-TK (December 1983)
The protocol is described on page 172 of that document.

This module also serves as sample code for writing standalone program
applications in Python.  For the corresponding built-in module version
of MIRROR (which is the one that is the default built-in object 25) see
modules/mirror.py.

    """The main program for this process-level object.  It is started as
    a subprocess by pydecnet, with pipes for the three standard file
    descriptors.

    stdin carries a stream of JSON objects (one per line) which deliver
    Session Control messages for this program.

    stdout carries a stream of JSON objects (one per line) which contain
    requests from the program to Session control.

    stderror may be used for logging.  (TODO: should this be a config
    option?)  Normally it carries JSON objects (one per line) that are
    used as arguments for a logging.log call in pydecnet.  If a line is
    not a valid JSON encoded object, it is instead logged as a plain
    text message.

    A simple request/response server program such as MIRROR can simply
    wait for input, parse it and generate a response, then wait some
    more.  Applications that need to be full-duplex would typically
    create a helper thread so there is a thread for each direction.

    When done (typically when the last connection is closed, or earlier
    if something goes wrong) the program should exit.  If it exits
    prematurely, pydecnet will close any currently open connections.
