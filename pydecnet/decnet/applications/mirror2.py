""" Mirror (loopback application) implementation.

Implementation of the DECnet network management loopback protocol.
Refer to the specification:
    DECnet Digital Network Architecture Phase IV
    Network Management Functional Specification
    Order no. AA-X437A-TK (December 1983)
The protocol is described on page 172 of that document.

This module also serves as sample code for writing standalone program
applications in Python.  For the corresponding built-in module version
of MIRROR (which is the one that is the default built-in object 25) see
modules/mirror.py.  

This version uses the SimplePipeConnector to wrap the low level JSON
interface.
