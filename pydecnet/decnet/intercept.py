"""DECnet Phase II "intercept" feature

Intercept is the term used in the Phase II architecture to describe a
rudimentary routing feature.  Many Phase II implementations only
support communication with neighbor nodes.  But in TOPS-20 systems,
the communication front-end is treated as a separate node, so such a
restriction would make the product useless.  To get around this, the
front end implements "intercept" which lets it forward packets from
the connected TOPS-20 host to adjacent other Phase II nodes.  The host
indicates who to talk to using a routing header; unlike Phase III and
later, this header uses node names, not node numbers.

For the specification of this feature, see the DECnet PHase II NSP
spec, order number AA-D600A-TC, Appendix F.

Intercept is enabled by default, but can be turned off with the
--no-intercept switch on the "routing" statement in the node
configuration.  More precisely, there are four operating modes for a
node, when interacting with Phase II neighbors:

1. No intercept: analogous to most Phase II nodes, which neither
request nor offer intercept (routing) services.  Adjacent Phase II
nodes can only communicate with this node.

2. End-node intercept.  This case applies to Phase II nodes by
default, and to Phase III or IV endnode type.  These will request
intercept if this node or the neighbor is Phase II; if offered, route
headers will be used to attempt to reach non-adjacent nodes.

3. Full intercept, this node is a Phase II router (with multiple
circuits).  This can be requested for Phase II nodes by configuration,
provided the node has multiple circuits, but it is not the default.
The node offers intercept service; if requested, it will process route
headers and forward packets accordingly.  As specified in the
architecture specification, intercept tracks connections mainly so it
can handle packets during the life of the connection that don't have
route headers, since these are optional for most packet types.

4. Intercept, this node is a Phase III or IV router.  Similar to Phase
II full intercept, but since Phase III/IV networks can drop packets,
intercept will save a copy of data packets (anything that is
acknowledged) and will retransmit these if needed (until acknowledged
or timeout).  (TODO: this packet tracking and timeout handling is not
yet implemented.)
