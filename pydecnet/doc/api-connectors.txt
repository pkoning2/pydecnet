PyDECnet API connectors

While any application can use the raw JSON interface to communicate
with either the general or the session control layer API of PyDECnet,
it may be more convenient to use a wrapper that has a more procedural
interface.  PyDECnet offers two of these: a "simple" connector that is
intended for applications that deal with a single operation stream
with requests and responses arriving in a predictable pattern, and an
"async" connector that uses the Python "asyncio" multi-tasking
mechanism to handle multiple full duplex data streams.

Both connector styles come in two variants, one that uses the Unix
socket based "general" API, and one that uses the subprocess pipes for
use in file-based DECnet objects to communicate with the session
control API.  

Simple API

This is found in module decnet.connectors; the two variants are
SimpleApiConnector and SimplePipeConnector.

Sample code using the simple API can be found in samples/apitest2.py
and decnet/applications/mirror2.py.  Also, NCP (applications/ncp) uses
the simple API connector.

Async API

This is found in module decnet.async_connectors; the two variants are
AsyncApiConnector and AsyncPipeConnector.

Sample code using the simple API can be found in samples/apitest3.py
and decnet/applications/mirror3.py.  Also, rcclient
(applications/rcclient), the MOP remote console client program, uses
the async API.
