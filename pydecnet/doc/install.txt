Prerequisites

PyDECnet requires Python 3.3 or later.

Apart from standard Python modules, pydecnet uses the following
optional modules:

1. python-daemon: if present, the --daemon command line option is
   available.
2. PyYAML: if present, the logging configuration file specified by the
   --log-config command line option can be a YAML file.  If not, only
   JSON configuration files are supported.
3. python-pam: if present, username/password authentication for DECnet
   objects is available.

You can check what optional libraries are installed using this
command:

   pip3 list
   

Installation

Installation from the Subversion repository

You can get the current code using the Subversion tool, from the
PyDECnet repository:

   svn co svn://akdesign.dyndns.org/pydecnet/trunk/pydecnet

You can then install from the resulting working directory:

   cd pydecnet
   python3 setup.py install

Installation from the kit

TODO: right now kits are not yet distributed.  

Installation of pydecnet from the kit (source tar archive) is done
using the standard "pip" tool:

   pip3 install decnet-1.0.tar.gz

Unit test

PyDECnet comes with a unit test collection.  This is mostly for
development use, but feel free to use it.  To invoke it:

   cd pydecnet
   python3 -m unittest discover

where "pydecnet" is the Subversion working directory or the top level
directory of the unpacked source tar archive, according to which you
used to get PyDECnet.  You can specify a particular Python 3.x to run
the unit test collection against that particular Python release.
