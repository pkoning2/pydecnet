Prerequisites

PyDECnet requires Python 3.3 or later.

Apart from standard Python modules, it requires the python-daemon
module.  The sample programs apitest2 and rctest use the "requests"
module. 

Installation

PyDECnet is a conventional pure Python module together with a top
level script ("pydecnet").  To install it, extract the source tarball,
and invoke setup.py:

    python3.3 setup.py install

Substitute another python if appropriate; Python 3.3 is the minimum
supported version.

Unit test

PyDECnet comes with a unit test collection.  This is mostly for
development use, but feel free to use it.  To invoke it, use this
command: 

    python3.3 -m unittest discover

Add "-v" to the end to see the name of each executed test as it runs.
