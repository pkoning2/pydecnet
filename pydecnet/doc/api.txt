DECnet/Python API  V3.0

PyDECnet has two APIs, a general one and a session control only one.
The general API is available to any external application, provided the
API feature is enabled in the configuration files.  The session
control API is used by session control when communicating with objects
defined as "file" type objects, i.e., those that are handled by
starting a subprocess.

The general API communicates with PyDECnet via a Unix domain socket.
The session control API communicates via a set of three pipes that are
bound (in the subprocess) to stdin, stdout, and stderr.

There are two sets of helper APIs to wrap a higher level (procedural)
interface around the JSON interface.  For documentation on those
"connectors", see doc/api-connectors.txt.  That interface is
recommended; the underlying JSON version of the session control API
should be viewed as an internal detail which remains available for
historic reasons but is best avoided.

Note that some DECnet objects are implemented as modules, running
within the context of the PyDECnet process.  This is necessary for
certain objects that operate directly on DECnet internal state, such
as the management listener NML.  It is also done, for convenience, for
the default MIRROR object.  For other applications this technique is
not recommended; the file (subprocess) style of object should be used
instead. 

API data flow

Both APIs use a bidirectional stream of JSON encoded operations.  Each
operation is sent as a single text line, which carries a JSON encoded
dictionary object.  In the documentation below the JSON messages are
shown in pretty-printed form, but note that this is NOT a legal
formatting for API requests since the entire JSON message must be on a
single line (no embedded newline codes).

JSON is a text encoding.  To represent binary (bytes) data, it is
carried as a string obtained by decoding the bytes data as "latin1" --
which is a one-to-one mapping of the 256 byte values onto the same
character codes.

Standard keys

The general API supports PyDECnet instances running multiple nodes; if
that is done, the specific node to which the request is targeted is
named by the "system" key in the request dictionary.  Within a node,
multiple components support API requests; the component to receive the
particular request is named by the "api" key.

Except for the "get system list" request (see below) all general API
requests must include the "api" key, and if the PyDECnet instance has
multiple nodes, they must also include the "system" key.

Both APIs identify the requested operation or action by the "type"
key.  If omitted, the default action is "get".

Since the API is a full duplex data stream, it is possible, depending
on what is being done, for messages to arrive at the API client
related to several concurrent activities.  A simple example is an API
using a DECnet connection, where incoming messages will appear as API
messages as they arrive.  It may also happen if request/response
exchanges are made where the response is asynchronous, for example a
"loop" operation.  To allow responses to be associated correctly with
requests, every request may include a "tag" key.  If it does, the
response for that request (if it has one) will include that same tag.
The client is responsible for avoiding duplicate tag values.

Except for the "get systems list" response, general API responses
(messages from PyDECnet to the client) always include the "system",
"api" and "type" keys corresponding to what was specified or defaulted
in the request.  A "tag" key is included in the response if it was
present in the request.  For clarity, the example responses below
generally omit the standard keys.

Connections

"Connections" are objects that live beyond a single request.  The
typical example is a DECnet Session Control connection, but MOP
Console Carrier client instances are also connections since they have
similar properties.  Connections live for some time, and represent a
full duplex data stream as opposed to a sequence of request/response
exchanges.

Messages associated with a connection are identified by a "handle" key
in the message; the value is an integer which is unique during the
life of that connection.  PyDECnet allocates a new connection when it
processes a connection create, and reports the new handle in the
resulting message to the client (the response message to a client
connect request, or the connect message for incoming connections).
All subsequent messages for that connection must include that same
handle.  The connection is deallocated and its handle released when
the connection is closed.

Connection life cycle

The process of creating a connection differs for the inbound (DECnet
only) vs. outbound case.  Once the connection is active, data can flow
in either direction in "data" messages, and in the case of DECnet
connections, also in "interrupt" messages.

A connection is closed by a "disconnect" or "abort" request; both
close the connection but (in the case of DECnet connections) generate
different disconnect reason codes to the other end.  A connection can
also be closed by PyDECnet with a "disconnect" message which includes
a disconnect reason code.

All connections associated with an API connection are closed if the
API connection closes; for example, if the API client process
terminates unexpectedly, any connections it has open at the time are
cleaned up.  

Outbound connections

An outbound connection is created by a "connect" message.  Once the
arguments have been validated and a connection handle has been
allocated, PyDECnet responds with a "connecting" message with the
handle.  At this point, protocol operation to establish the
communication has started.

Successful creation of the connection with the destination is
indicated by an "accept" message; failure by a "reject" message
(which frees the connection handle).

Inbound connections (DECnet only)

An inbound connection is reported by a "connect" message which
includes the connection handle for the new connection.  The API client
has to respond to the message by sending "accept" to accept the
connection, or "reject" to refuse it (which releases the connection).

Description of the general API

Get system list

A general API request containing an empty dictionary (or actually, any
request that does not contain an "api" key) produces a response that
is a dictionary keyed by the system named, with as value a list of the
valid "api" values for that node.  Example:

{
   "PYTS41" : [
      "mop",
      "routing",
      "nsp",
      "session",
      "ncp"
   ]
}

API for "mop"

The MOP API supports request types "get", "loop", "counters" and
"connect".

Get request for MOP

A "get" request returns information about the circuits handled by MOP,
for example:

{
   "circuits" : [
      {
         "name" : "ETH-0",
         "hwaddr" : "aa-00-03-00-42-73",
         "macaddr" : "aa-00-04-00-29-a4",
         "services" : [
            "loop",
            "counters"
         ]
      }
   ],
   "system" : "PYTS41",
   "api" : "mop"
}

Sysid request for MOP

A "sysid" request returns the current contents of the SysID message
listener for the circuit specified by the "circuit" key in the
request, which is required.  This is only valid for Ethernet circuits.
The return item "sysid" contains a list of entries, each of which is a
dictionary with keys naming the SysID message fields.  For example:

{
   "sysid" : [
      {
         "srcaddr" : "52-50-38-90-e0-f7",
         "console_user" : "",
         "reservation_timer" : 0,
         "hwaddr" : "52-50-38-90-e0-f7",
         "device" : "PCL11-B UNIBUS multiple CPU link",
         "processor" : "Communication Server",
         "datalink" : "CSMA-CD",
         "software" : "DECnet/Python",
         "services" : [
            "loop",
            "counters"
         ]
      }
   ],
   "system" : "PYTS41",
   "api" : "mop"
}

Loop request for MOP

A "loop" request performs an Ethernet loop operation.  The request
must include the "circuit" key to specify the name of the Ethernet
circuit to use, and it may include optional parameters to control the
specific operation.  

{
   "api" : "mop",
   "type" : "loop",
   "circuit" : "eth-0",
   "dest" : "2e-ca-55-6b-f1-57",
   "packets" : 3,
   "timeout" : 3,
   "fast" : true
}

All parameters except "circuit" are optional.

"dest" is either a single destination address (a string in the usual
form for Ethernet addresses), or a list of up to three addresses.  If
omitted, the loopback assistance multicast address CF-00-00-00-00-00
is used. If more than one address is specified, or the destination
address is not the loopback assistance address, they must be a
unitcast address.  The loop packet visits the addresses in the list in
that order, so a single address corresponds to a simple loop operation
while lists of 2 or 3 entries can be used to implement the "loopback
assistant" mechanisms described in the spec, i.e., testing
connectivity via some intermediate station.

"packets" is the number of loop request/response operations to
perform, default is 1.  "timeout" is the response timeout for each
request sent, in seconds, default is 3.  "fast" is a Boolean, default
is false.  If false, there is a one second delay after each successful
loop exchange (not after a timeout because we already waited for the
timeout delay); if true, the next request is sent immediately upon
receipt of the preceding reply.  Fast mode should be done with caution
because of the added load on the network.

The reply is a dictionary containing the overall operation status and
a list of round trip delays, in seconds (floating point).  Timeout is
represented by a value of -1.  There is one list entry per loop
packet.  If the destination address was the loopback assistance
multicast address, that is only used for the first request and the
address of whichever station replies first is used for subsequent
requests; in addition, that address is also returned in the reply.
For example:

{
   "status" : "ok",
   "dest" : "aa-00-04-00-0b-08",
   "delays" : [
      0.0015108585357666,
      0.00301599502563477,
      0.00173497200012207,
      0.00295305252075195,
      0.00289678573608398
   ]
}

Console carrier request for MOP

A "connect" request opens a MOP console carrier connection.  If the
connection can be made, a connection object is allocated and its
handle is included in the response.  That starts the full-duplex data
flow for the console.  Subsequent input to the console is sent as
"data" type messages on the connection, and console output arrives
from PyDECnet in "data" messages.  To close the connection, issue a
"disconnect" request to the connection.

The "connect" request to begin a session must contain parameters
"circuit" (the Ethernet circuit on which to make the connection),
"dest" (the destination MAC address) and "verification" (the MOP
console carrier verification string, essentially an access password.
All are required.  For example:

{
   "api" : "mop",
   "type" : "connect",
   "circuit" : "eth-0",
   "verification" : "Plugh",
   "dest" : "aa-00-04-00-0b-08"
}

If the arguments are valid, a connection state is allocated for the
console carrier connection, which is returned in a "connecting" message:

{
   "handle" : 8246003421459976741,
   "type" : "connecting"
}

At this point the console carrier protocol has started.  The next
message will be an "accept" if console carrier operation with the
specified destination was accepted, or "reject" if it was not.

After "accept", data messages (with "type" : "data") can flow in
either directory to deliver console input or output.  To end the
console carrier session, issue a "disconnect" request.

Get counts request for MOP

The "counters" operation issues a MOP Request Counters message to a station on
the specified Ethernet.  The request data is a JSON encoded dictionary
specifying the request parameters:

{
   "api" : "mop",
   "type" : "counters",
   "circuit" : "eth-0",
   "dest" : "f2-63-1f-8d-f8-94",
   "timeout" : 2
}

Timeout is an optional timeout for the request, in seconds.  Default
is 3 seconds.  The other parameters are required.

The reply is a JSON encoded dictionary reporting the counters obtained
from the station, or an error status indicating failure to obtain the
information.  For example:

{
   "status" : "timeout"
}

or

{
   "status" : "ok",
   "bytes_recv" : 20307435,
   "bytes_sent" : 287272492,
   "pkts_recv" : 43851,
   "pkts_sent" : 774216,
   "mcbytes_recv" : 20273556,
   "mcpkts_recv" : 43408,
   "pkts_deferred" : 0,
   "pkts_1_collision" : 0,
   "pkts_mult_collision" : 0,
   "send_fail" : 0,
   "recv_fail" : 0,
   "unk_dest" : 0,
   "data_overrun" : 0,
   "no_sys_buf" : 0,
   "no_user_buf" : 0,
   "time_since_zeroed" : 65535,
}

API for Routing

Routing supports the "get" requests for the routing layer and for
individual circuits.

GET for routing

A GET request without a "circuit" argument returns some basic
information about the DECnet node, and a list of circuit names.  For
example:

{
   "version" : "2.0.0",
   "circuits" : [
      "MUL-0",
      "ETH-102"
   ],
   "address" : 42025,
   "name" : "PYTS41",
   "type" : "L1 router",
   "version" : "2.0.0",
   "system" : "PYTS41",
   "api" : "routing",
}

GET requests for a specific Routing circuit

To obtain information from Routing about a specific circuit, include
the "circuit" parameter giving the circuit name.  The information
returned depends on whether the circuit is point to point (such as
DDCMP) or a LAN circuit (Ethernet).

Example of point to point circuit response:

{
   "name" : "MUL-187",
   "state" : "ru4l1",
   "hello_timer" : 60,
   "cost" : 4,
   "neighbor" : 42171,
   "type" : "L1 router",
   "blocksize" : 576,
   "version" : "2.0.0",
   "listen_timer" : 63,
}

For a LAN circuit on a router, the response includes a list of
adjacencies, each of which gives a dictionary of attributes for that
particular adjacency.  For example:

{
   "name" : "ETH-0",
   "is_dr" : false,
   "hello_timer" : 15,
   "priority" : 42,
   "cost" : 3,
   "designated_router" : "41.1",
   "adjacencies" : [
      {
         "neighbor" : 41985,
         "blocksize" : 591,
         "listen_timer" : 46,
         "type" : "Area router",
         "version" : "2.0.0",
         "priority" : 64
      }
   ],
}

For a LAN circuit on an end node, the response shows the current
designated router, if known.  For example:

{
   "name" : "ETH-102",
   "hello_timer" : 10,
   "designated_router" : {
      "type" : "Area router",
      "version" : "2.0.0",
      "blocksize" : 591,
      "priority" : 64,
      "neighbor" : 2049,
      "listen_timer" : 30
   }
}

//TODO after this.

API for Bridge

A GET request for the bridge returns the bridge name and a list of
circuits, for example:

{
   "name" : "br-0",
   "circuits" : [
      "ETH-42",
      "ETH-43"
   ]
}

A GET request addressed to api/bridge/circuits returns a list of
circuits in this bridge.

A GET request addressed to api/bridge/circuits/<circuitname> returns
information about that circuit.  You can use * for <circuitname> to
get back a list of information for all the circuits in this bridge.
The reply for a circuit gives the circuit name and the list of
Ethernet protocol types enabled for bridging on that circuit, for
example:

{
   "name" : "ETH-43",
   "protocols" : [
      "90-00",
      "60-04",
      "60-01",
      "60-02",
      "60-03"
   ]
}

A GET request to bridge/addrdb returns the address database
(forwarding database) of the bridge, in the form of a dictionary keyed
by destination MAC address with the circuit to forward to as the
value.  For example:

{
   "aa-00-04-00-01-08" : "ETH-43",
   "aa-00-04-00-0b-08" : "ETH-42"
}

API for NCP

NML, the NICE protocol server, is reachable over a regular DECnet
connection, so long as the object (number 19) has not been disabled in
the configuration.  For local use, an equivalent API is also available
through the "ncp" API.  This works in all cases, it does not depend on
the NML object being defined.

An NCP request has the general form:

{
    "type" : "nice",
    "data": "\x12\x00\x06PYTHON",
    "api" : "ncp"
}

The "data" parameter is a NICE request in its encoded form, as a
latin-1 string so each byte corresponds to a character.  The request
shown here corresponds to the NCP command "LOOP NODE PYTHON".

The response is similar in structure, except that the "data" parameter
is a list consisting of all the NICE response messages that make up
the complete response to the request.  For many requests the response
contains just one message, but for "show" commands where multiple
items are returned (say, for "show known circuits") the list will have
multiple entries.  Note that the empty "start of multiple responses"
(status 2) and "end of multiple responses" (status -128) NICE protocol
messages are omitted; only actual information responses are included
in the list.  For example:

{
    "api" : "ncp",
    "data": [ "\x01\xff\xff\x00" ]
}

The response shown here is a "success" status.

API for Session

As stated above, the API described here (using JSON) exists mostly for
historic and internal purposes, and for new work the API "connector"
mechanism is recommended.  See doc/api-connectors.txt for
documentation of that API.

The PyDECnet session layer has two slightly different APIs.

Session control accepts messages from the general API directed to api
key "session".  It also supports the session control specific API over
pipes, used for the case of DECnet session control objects implemented
as executable files with the "--file" switch in an "object"
configuration line.  Those are run as subprocesses, with messages from
PyDECnet arriving on the "stdin" file descriptor of that subprocess,
and messages to PyDECnet are written to "stdout".  The pipe API is
implicitly limited to session control of a particular node, so the
"system" and "api" keys are not applicable and must not be included.

The session control API requests (in the "type" key) are: "connect",
"accept", "reject", "data", "interrupt", "disconnect", "abort" and
"setsockopt".  Messages from PyDECnet to the API client have type keys
"connecting", "connect", "accept", "reject", "data", "interrupt" and
"disconnect". The "connect" request to PyDECnet (a request to initiate
a new connection) is a request/response exchange where the request
does not include a connection handle (the response does, representing
the newly allocated connection).  All other messages in both
directions are associated with a connection and therefore include a
"handle" parameter, and none of these produce any response.

The "connect" message has some additional parameters.  The access
control related parameters are present only if access control
validation is set to "on" for this object, and the parameter values
were valid.

"destination" -- the remote node number or, if the node name is known,
a two-item list consisting of node number and node name.

"username" -- the access control user name, if present and valid.
"password" -- 1 if a password was present and valid.
"account" -- the access control account string, if present and valid.

Session control outbound connection request

The request has a number of parameters, mostly optional:

{
    "type" : "connect",
    "dest" : "MIM",
    "remuser" : 19,
    "data" : "conndata",
    "srcname" : "MyApiUser",
    "proxy" : false,
    "username" : "nobody",
    "password" : "magic",
    "account" : "abc123"
}

"dest" is the destination node name or node number.  "remuser" is the
destination object name or number.  Both are required.  The other
parameters are optional.  "srcname" is the source user identification,
defaults is "PyDECnet".  "proxy" is true for proxy requests (details
TBS), default is false.  Username, password, and account are the
DECnet standard access control credentials; each defaults to empty.

The response is a message with the newly allocated connection handle
and type "connecting".  The outcome of the connect request is reported
in a subsequent message, either "accept" if the destination process
accepted the connection, or "reject" if the connection could not be
made.

Session control object bind request

This request allows an application to register for inbound connections
to a specified object number and/or object name.  It corresponds
roughly to the TCP socket "bind" operation.  The request parameters
are:

{
    "type" : "bind",
    "num" : 25,
    "name" : "MIRROR",
    "auth" : "off"
}

"num" is the object number, "name" is the object name to be
registered.  At least one must be given.  The name, if given, is
converted to upper case.  The number and/or name must not already be
in use by another object.  For example, the registration attempt shown
above will typically fail because object 25 (MIRROR) is registered as
an internal PyDECnet object by default.  But if
"object --number 25 --disable" is present in the configuration, those
identifiers are available.

The response is a message with type "bind" and a handle.  That handle
is not a normal connection handle but it is a reference to the bind
state.  To release the binding, issue a "disconnect" request on that
handle.  In any case, any bindings are freed when the API is closed.

The other session API requests perform operations on an open socket.
The socket is identified by the "handle" key which is required.
"type" is the operation.  Defined operations are:

accept -- respond to a "connect" message by accepting the connection.
"data" specified optional accept data, 0 to 16 bytes.

reject -- responds to a "connect" message by rejecting the connection.

data -- sends normal data, given  by the "data" key.

interrupt -- sends interrupt data, given by the "data" key.

disconnect -- closes the connection.

abort -- closes the connection with an "aborted" reason code.

If a connection is still open when the API is closed (the Unix socket
connection from application to PyDECnet is closed, or the application
process exited) those connections will be disconnected with reason
code 38, "Object failed".
