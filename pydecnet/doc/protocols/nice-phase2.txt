There appears to be a NICE protocol (remote management access) in
Phase II, but there is no spec for it.  The following is reverse
engineerd from TOPS-20 V4.1, which has client and server support for
this protocol.

Phase II NICE uses the same object number (19) as Phase III/IV.  The
connect data is absent (in Phase III/IV it contains a 3-byte version
number).

For each connection a single command is sent.  Once the response has
been received, the TOPS-20 client disconnects.  The server (NCU) does
not require this behavior; the comments state that several requests
may be sent on a single connection, one at a time.

Each NICE request starts with a one-byte function code.  The code
points assigned in Phase II are distinct from (lower than) the ones in
the Phase III and IV NICE protocol.

Some of the operations described below have code points assigned but
are not implemented in TOPS-20 V4.1.  "not implemented" in
descriptions below means not implemented in TOPS-20 V4.1.  I don't
have access to other Phase II implementations so I don't know what
their NML does, or even if they have one.

Function codes:

1: Log data
2: Request downline load
3: Request upline dump
4: Trigger boot
5: Loopback
6: Request loop test
7: Set parameter
8: Read information
9: Zero counters
14: Line service

The second byte supplies additional detail of the requested function
in some cases:

Function 8 (read information):
0: Local node counters (not implemented)
1: Local node status
2: Remote note counters (not implemented)
3: Remote node status (not implemented)
4: Line counters
5: Line status
6: Routing paths (not implemented)

For functions 4 and 5 additional bytes specify what line(s) to operate
on:
0: known lines
1: specific line, coded ID
2: specific line, counted string ID (not implemented)

The coded ID consists of the line device code (almost the same as the
MOP Phase III/IV device codes, for example 28 for KMC-DUP) followed by
3 bytes.  The third byte appears to be unused (the comments suggest is
is reserved for "station" number, i.e., tributary address).  The other
two make up the two numbers in the standard device ID.  For example,
line KDP_0_1 is coded as 1c 00 01 00.

The device codes are:
       0    DP    DP11-DA
       2    DU    DU11-DA synchronous line interface
       4    DL    DL11-C, -E or -WA asynchronous line interface
       6    DQ    DQ11-DA (OBSOLETE)
       8    DA    DA11-B or -AL UNIBUS link
      10    DUP   DUP11-DA synchronous line interface
      12    DMC   DMC11-DA/AR, -FA/AR, -MA/AL or -MD/AL interprocessor link
  *   14    DLV   DLV11, MXV11 asynchronous line interface
  *   16          DL11-A
      20    DTE   DTE20 PDP-11 to KL10 interface
      22    DV    DV11-AA/BA synchronous line multiplexer
      28    KDP   KMC11/DUP11-DA synchronous line multiplexer
      30    KDZ   KMC11/DZ11-A, -B, -C, or -D asynchronous line multiplexer

Entries marked with * differ from the MOP Phase III/IV device codes.

The response to a NICE request consists of several messages.  The
first message begins with a status code (one byte, signed).  If the
operation is Read Information and the status is "success" (+1) there
are two more bytes, the count of messages to follow (2 bytes little
endian).

Many of the codes match those in the Phase III/IV NICE, but a few are
different:

+1: Success
-1: Invalid function code or option
-2: Invalid message format
-3: Insufficient status
-4: NICE protocol error
-5: NICE process program error
-8: Invalid line ID
-9: Invalid line state
-10: Line communications error
-11: Invalid node ID
-12: Invalid server node ID
-13: Invalid file
-14: Invalid configuration file
-15: Resource error
-16: Invalid parameter value
-17: Line protocol error
-18: File I/O error
-19: Network communications error
-20: No room for new entry
-21: Remote NCU process not available

Following the status message are data messages, if the operation was
"read information".

Local node status reply:

- Type code (one byte: 01)
- Node name (counted string)
- Node number (one byte)
- Status (one byte: 0 = On, 1 = Off, 2 = Shut)
- Filler (2 bytes: 00 00 -- reserved for "maintenance logging state"
    and "operator logging state)
- Default host name (counted string)
- Routing version (3 bytes)
- Comm version (3 bytes)
- System version (counted string)

Line status reply:

- Type code (one byte: 05)
- Line ID (see above, same coding as line ID in the request)
- Line status (one byte: 0 = On, 1 = Off, 4 = Maintenance, 5 =
    Controller loopback, 6 = Cable loopback)
- Filler (2 bytes: 00 00)
- Adjacent node name (counted string)

Line counters reply:
- Type code (one byte: 04)
- Line ID (see above, same coding as line ID in the request)
- One or more counters, each encoded as follows:
-- Counter code, (normally one byte, extensible coded)
-- Counter value (2 bytes little endian)

Counter codes are:

0: Seconds since zeroed
1: Blocks received
2: Blocks sent
3: Retran, line errors
4: Received line errors
5: Retran, not line errors
6: Receive timeouts
7: Receive select errors
8: Resource errors
