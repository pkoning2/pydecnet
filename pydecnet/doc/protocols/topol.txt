This describes the TOPS-20 V4 "topology notification" protocol used by
TOPS-20 Phase II DECnet to obtain information about the network
topology from its neighbors.  It appears to be intended mostly to ask
the PDP-11 front end processor for that information, but it is also
used in 2020 systems where the request is directed at whatever node
happens to be adjacent.

In the description below, "client" means the TOPS-20 system initiating
the request, and "server" is the other node (front end or other
neighbor) answering.

Connect initiate is by object name: "TOPOL".

The protocol sends and receives data in 8-bit bytes.

After connecting, the client sends 5 bytes:

Request code: 1
Version code: 6
Version data: 01 00 00

The server replies with its data, which must fit in a page.  The
client reads 8-bit bytes, 2048 bytes max.  The message starts with a 5
byte header, which must match exactly.

Response code: 2
Version code: 6
Version data: 01 00 00

Next is the count of items returned:

Count code: 7
Count value: <one byte>

Next are the data items, as many as the count says.  Each begins with
an item code:

1: node name
2: node number
3. node state
4: line ID
5: line state
(6: version info -- invalid as a topology item, used only in header)
(7: node units to follow -- invalid as a topology item)

Following the item code is the item, encoded as follows:

1. Node name: counted string: one byte length, n bytes ASCII name
2. Node number: extensible value (7 bits per byte with "more" flag)
3. Note state: one byte, encoded ???
4. Line ID: counted string.  Not used (skipped) by client.
5. Line status: one byte, encoded ???.  Not used by client.
