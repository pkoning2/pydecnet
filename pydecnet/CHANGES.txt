This document summarizes significant changes in the code, newest
change at the top.  "Significant" means a non-trivial functional
change or a change that affects how you use or install the
application.

1.0-570: IPv6 support, which introduces new configuration file options
for circuits and http.  The old syntax for circuit destination
configuration specs still works but is deprecated (it's harder to use)
and does not handle IPv6 addresses.
PyDECnet now requires the psutil module.

1.0-556: Ethernet "tap" support for Linux is now included, thanks to
Keith Halewood for supplying the patch.  

1.0-552: Allow configuration records to override (supplement) earlier
ones with certain restrictions.  See doc/config.txt for details.

1.0-539: Remove the pydecnet script.  This is now created by the
installation procedure.  See doc/install.txt for details.
