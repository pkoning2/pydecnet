This document summarizes significant changes in the code, newest
change at the top.  "Significant" means a non-trivial functional
change or a change that affects how you use or install the
application.

1.0-584: Since the circuit configuration switches --destination,
--dest-port, --source, and --source-port were confusing for "listen"
mode circuits and other cases where one would naturally think in terms
of inbound traffic, this version introduces new switches
--remote-address, --remote-port, --local-address, and --local-port
respectively.  The old names still work but the new names are the
documented ones and are preferred.

1.0-575: Correct documentation omission: in rev 570, the circuit
configuration spec was changed so "0.0.0.0" is no longer recognized as
"any address allowed".  Instead, use an empty address or the special
value "*".

1.0-570: IPv6 support, which introduces new configuration file options
for circuits and http.  The old syntax for circuit destination
configuration specs still works but is deprecated (it's harder to use)
and does not handle IPv6 addresses.
PyDECnet now requires the psutil module.

1.0-556: Ethernet "tap" support for Linux is now included, thanks to
Keith Halewood for supplying the patch.  

1.0-552: Allow configuration records to override (supplement) earlier
ones with certain restrictions.  See doc/config.txt for details.

1.0-539: Remove the pydecnet script.  This is now created by the
installation procedure.  See doc/install.txt for details.
